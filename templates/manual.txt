1) My Style 
    I like moving fast, shooting high, and dropping things when I miss.

2) What I value
    I value people that learn from their mistakes, and are willing to learn

3) How to best communicate with me
    Just say what you mean. I will not be offended by complaints, and certainly
    not by contructive criticism. I will take you at your word.

4) How to help me
    Tell me why im wrong. Tell my why you think that and what I can do to improve.

5) What I don't have patience for 
    I don't have patience for stubborn-ness, and I don't have patience for arrogance.

6) What people misunderstand about me
    I will argue with you over anything, but that doesn't mean I dissagree. Often I
    argue as the devil's advocate, because I feel it lets me understand a problem better.
    When I'm trying to find flaws in your idea, it usually means I like it.
